\begin{acknowledge}
    First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Wei Tsang Ooi, for his continuous support and guidance. 
    Wei Tsang always encourages me to try the new ideas and guides me to the promising direction. He has taught me not only a lot of valuable knowledge
    but also many skills essential to a researcher, such as writing papers, preparing slides, and making presentations. 
    I am also very grateful to him for his patience in improving my papers, presentations, and thesis. 
    I could not imagine finishing the thesis and the Ph.D. candidature without his help.

    I also would like to thank Dr. Kok-Lim Low, who gave me valuable help in computer graphics. I am thankful to Prof. Yong Chiang Tay for his
    wonderful course and precious advices on system modeling. I would like to thank my thesis committee members, Prof. Tiow Seng Tan and Dr. Kok-Lim Low, 
    for their constructive criticism to improve my thesis.

    I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Romulus Grigoras and Dr. G\'{e}raldine Morin for their continuous help during the collaboration. I would
    like especially thank Sebastien Mondet. Working together with him is one of the most productive periods in my Ph.D. candidature. 

    I am also grateful to Ransi De Silva for conducting the user study experiments and Dan Liu for her help in analyzing the user traces.
    I appreciate the generous help from Bingjun Zhang in my experiment. 
    I would like to thank all my colleges and friends, including Ma Lin, Nguyen Vu Thanh, Satish Verma, Pavel Korshunov, Balaji Raman, and Ke Liang for their
    sharing and accompanying.

    I can never express enough gratitude to my parents, who love me and support me unconditionally. Without their support and encouragement, I would have not
    begun the challenging Ph.D student life at my thirties. I also express my thanks to my brother and his family for their supports. 
    
    Finally, this thesis is dedicated to my wife, Jingyan Yuan, for her endless caring, understanding, encouragement, and love. I am so fortunate to have her
    accompanying, without which I could not have finally finished the candidature.

\chapter{Related Publications}
This thesis is based on several our published/accepted papers.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter \ref{c:model} is based on our paper accepted in TOMCCAP \cite{modeling:cheng}, which itself is an extended version of our paper published in ACM Multimedia 2007 \cite{1291399}.
    \item Chapter \ref{c:rdstream} is extended from our paper published in NOSSDAV 2008 \cite{Cheng2008} by adding the evaluation of screen-based method based PSNR curves.
    \item Chapter \ref{c:user} is partly based on our short paper published in ACM Multimedia 2009 \cite{towards:ransi}, except that the synthetic trace generation is newly added and the prediction part has been rewritten. 
    \item Chapter \ref{c:p2p} is based on our full paper published in ACM Multimedia 2009 \cite{peer:cheng}.
    \item The abstract of this thesis is presented at ACM Multimedia 2008 as a Doctoral Symposium Abstract \cite{cheng:streaming}.
