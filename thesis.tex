\chapter{Introduction}
\label{c:intro}
    Many networked 3D applications are emerging nowadays, 
    such as digital museums, virtual reality applications, 
    and 3D social games including Second Life and Google Lively. 
    In these applications, 3D representations of objects, 
    so called 3D models, are provided as the main contents instead of 2D images. 
    Compared with images, 3D models carry more information, 
    so they can be viewed from any direction and at any distance. 
    Moreover, 3D applications typically support user interactivity. 
    Hence, users can walk through a virtual 3D scene and move 3D objects
    as if they are in the real world. 

    Because 3D models are relatively difficult to create, 
    less 3D models exist online than images and videos. 
    With the advances in 3D modeling techniques, 
    such as 3D scanning technology, mesh reconstruction algorithm
    and 3D modeling softwares, however, many 3D models now have been available online, 
    such as the high resolution statues digitized by Stanford’s Digital Michelangelo Project,
    the 3D statues directly created by digital sculpture softwares like Zbrush, 
    and the simple solid models made by hundreds of thousands of users in Second Life. 
    Hence, it may be expected that 3D models may play a more important role 
    in multimedia streaming research in the near future.

    Traditional 3D games store all data of 3D models in users’ local disks, 
    but now some networked applications store the data on the server side 
    and transmit them from the server to users when they are needed. 
    The latter method has several advantages. 
    First, users can immediately start the application without buying a CD
    or downloading large amount of data. 
    Second, because the 3D data are stored in the server and shared by all the users, 
    users can create and modify objects and others can see the new objects immediately. 
    For example, many objects in Second Life are user-created, 
    and this feature is believed to be essential to success of Second Life. 

    High resolution 3D models have large amount of data, 
    so transmitting the data over networks with limited bandwidth needs long time. 
    To reduce the waiting time of the user, 
    the streaming technology can be used to transmit 3D data. 
    The 3D streaming technology enables users to render the partially received data as a preview, 
    and then improve the quality when more data are available. 
    Users can decide how many data to receive based on their requirement of quality
    and the rendering ability of their hardware. 

    Although audio and video streaming have been studied extensively, 
    3D streaming remains a new research area. 
    Video streaming and 3D streaming are significantly different
    due to the difference between videos and the representations of 3D models. 
    In Section \ref{s:intro:representation}, two common representations of 3D objects, 
    polygonal meshes and point-based representations, will be introduced. 
    Complex representations are often simplified to support different level of details. 
    In Section \ref{}, the simplification methods of meshes are briefly reviewed. 
    Then various coding schemes of polygonal meshes will be surveyed briefly in Section \ref{}, 
    and among them, the coding of progressive mesh will be introduced in detail. 
    Next, some important studies about streaming of progressive meshes
    are briefly reviewed in Section \ref{}, and more detailed reviews are presented in next chapter.
    Finally, the research problems of this thesis are stated in Section \ref{s:intro:problem}
    and the main contributions of this thesis are given in Section \ref{}.

    \section{Representations of 3D Objects}
    \label{s:intro:representation}
    A 3D object is represented with a certain model and often compressed
    to save storage space and transmission bandwidth. 
    The most popular representation of 3D objects is polygonal meshes, 
    especially the triangle meshes, because most graphic cards are optimized for triangle meshes. 
    Nonetheless, some other representations exist, 
    such as point-based meshes, which is better in some cases.
    \section{View-dependent Streaming}
    \label{s:intro:view_dependent}
    View-dependent technique is first proposed in adaptive rendering of complex 3D meshes. 
    View-dependent rendering systems only render vertices that contribute
    to the quality of rendered image. 
    The invisible vertices are not rendered. 
    Moreover, if the quality of a region of a mesh is good enough, 
    the vertex splits that further refine this region are ignored. 
    Therefore, real-time rendering of a complex mesh becomes possible 
    even for systems with limited rendering ability because the number
    of vertices to be rendered is significantly reduced. 

    Later, View-dependent technique is applied in progressive streaming of 3D meshes [4, 6, 7].
    Southern et al. [6] propose a system in which the client is stateless 
    and only stores the visible vertices of meshes. 
    In this system, when client changes viewpoint, 
    the server will send the newly visible vertices and the client 
    will drop the vertices out of the viewable area. 
    When a client returns to a previous viewpoint, 
    the sender has to send again the data previously sent already 
    and the bandwidth is wasted in duplicate transmission. 
    Therefore, this system is not appropriate for transmission
    over networks with limited bandwidth. 

    To et al. [7] and Kim et al. [4] prevent the server 
    from sending duplicate data by storing the received vertices data 
    in the client even when they become temporarily not needed. 
    Later, when the client returns to a previous viewpoint, 
    the data needed are still available from local storage, 
    so duplicate transmission is avoided. 
    These methods reduce the bandwidth needed in transmission, 
    but now the server has to remember that which part of mesh is sent
    and which part is not for each client. 
    To keep such information for each client increases the memory usage of the server, 
    and it makes the application of caching proxy and peer-to-peer technique, 
    two common solutions to increase the scalability, hard to be used.  
    Moreover, their studies are mainly addressing the limited rendering ability of the client,
    which is the bottleneck in that time. 
    Now with the advance of commodity graphic card technology, 
    the rendering ability increases so much that the network bandwidth becomes the main bottleneck
    in most cases. Hence, the focus of view-dependent streaming systems needs to be changed
    to address reducing transmission bandwidth.

    Yang et al. [8] and Zheng et al. [10] address reducing transmission bandwidth in their research. 
    The server in the system proposed by Yang et al. [8] decides the resolution of meshes
    according to the available network bandwidth. 
    Zheng et al. let the server predict users' viewpoints so that the server could send data in advance 
    to compensate the round-trip time with the rendering time. 
    In both systems, the sender decides which part of data to send based on complex algorithms. 
    When the mesh size and number of receivers are both large, the requirement of computing resources
    may beyond the ability of the server. 
    Hence, a more scalable way to support view-dependent steaming of large progressive meshes 
    to many receivers needs to be designed.
    
    In designing a view-dependent streaming system, 
    some challenges need to be considered. 
    In this section, the main challenges and the solutions in previous work are briefly introduced.

    The primary task of view-dependent streaming is finding an appropriate subset of refinements
    to generate a rendered image with satisfactory quality. 
    The flexibility of choosing vertex splits to send is crucial to enable this task, 
    but it is restricted by the dependency among the vertex splits. 
    Therefore, to reduce the dependency among vertex splits becomes a challenge in view-dependent streaming. 
    Some studies have been done to address this challenge. 
    To et al. [7] remove the cut-neighbor dependency by using a vertex's ancestor if it is not generated yet. 
    Their method is innovative but cannot preserve the original topology 
    and hence cannot be applied when accurate topology is required. 
    Kim and Lee [3] propose another way to remove the cut-neighbor dependency 
    and ensure the final mesh having the correct topology. 
    Kim et al. [4] further improve this method and significantly improve the compression efficiency. 
     Their scheme is neat since it significantly increases the flexibility in choosing vertex splits
    and meanwhile keeps the original connectivity. 
    It is applied in this thesis to reduce the cut-neighbor dependency.

    Another Challenge is how to keep the flexibility in choosing sending order
    when progressive meshes are encoded and compressed. 
    Most compression algorithms for progressive meshes choose a specific encoding order
    to reduce the redundancy by exploiting the correlation between consecutive vertex splits. 
    Moreover, the mesh compressed with traditional methods can only be sequentially decoded, 
    making changing sending order impossible. 
    Kim and Lee [2] propose a compression scheme allowing random decoding order
    and the same method is used by Yoon and Lindstrom [9]. 
    In the same time, the efficiency of their methods is close to the best compression algorithms available. 
    Their studies are very important since now we have the flexibility in choosing sending order, 
    which is essential in view-dependent streaming, with little loss of compression efficiency. 
    Although their methods are designed for local accessing of meshes, 
    it is possible to extend them to be used in network transmission. 
    \section{Problem Statement}
    \label{s:intro:problem}
    (summary)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No quantitative analysis has been done for 
            finding the effect of dependency 
            when progressive meshes are transmitted over lossy networks. 
        \item Sender-driven view-dependent streaming
            is not scalable to large number of receivers. 
        \item No peer-to-peer system 
            exists for view-dependent progressive mesh streaming. 
    \end{itemize}
    
    \section{Objectives and Scope}
    \label{s:intro:objectives}
    To address the problems introduced in Section 1.5, 
    the objectives of this thesis are listed as follows: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The first objective of this thesis is
            to quantitatively analyze how sending order affects
            the rendered quality of progressive meshes 
            during transmission over lossy network. 
            To achieve this objective, 
            an analytical model is proposed
            to estimate the decoding time of
            each vertex split by considering both
            the mesh property and network condition. 
            This model could help us to find some insights
            about the effect of dependency. 
            In addition, it may be applied to find a better sending strategy, 
            and a greedy strategy is given in the thesis as an example. 
            Compared with methods based on simulation, 
            analytical model is more efficient and may be used
            in the real time so that the sending order
            can be adaptive to the network condition.
        \item The second objective is to implement view-dependent streaming
            in a more scalable way. A receiver-driven approach is proposed 
            to move the visibility decision from the sender to the receiver.
            The receiver-driven approach increase the scalability
            not only because it reduce the the CPU overhead of the sender 
            but also because it makes the caching proxy and peer-to-peer much easier
            to be applied to remove the bandwidth bottleneck on the sender side.
            The application of receiver-driven approach could eventually
            make possible the view-dependent streaming of large meshes
            to huge number of receivers.
        \item The third objective of this thesis to examine the possibility 
            of implementing a peer-to-peer view-dependent streaming system. 
            The receiver-driven approach proposed in this thesis 
            makes the peer-to-peer system possible, 
            but some challenges still exist such as how to reduce the response time
            and message overhead. 
            The prototype proposed in this thesis could give some insights
            to the future research on this area. 
            Eventually, peer-to-peer system should be an attractive way 
            to bring the streaming of large meshes into practice. 
    \end{enumerate}

    Only streaming of static 3D objects is considered in this thesis. 
    Streaming of 3D animations beyonds the scope of this thesis. 
    Moreover, streaming of 3D scenes is not concerned in this thesis.
    Instead, this thesis concentrates on streaming of one large mesh.
    Nonetheless, streaming of 3D scenes becomes easier when mature methods
    of streaming of single objects exist because a 3D scene is the collection
    of multiple single meshes. 
    Finally, this thesis focuses on the streaming of progressive meshes. 
    Streaming of other representations of 3D objects is not discussed in this thesis,
    but the methods proposed in this thesis should be possible
    extended to support streaming of other representations with some modifications.

    In next chapter, existed studies about streaming of progressive mesh
    will be introduced. 
    First, various ways to improve the quality when progressive meshes are transmitted
    over lossy network are reviewed.
    Second, previous view-dependent streaming systems of progressive meshes are introduced
    and why these sender-driven approaches are not scalable is explained. 
    Finally, peer-to-peer techniques are introduced briefly
    and the difference between peer-to-peer video streaming
    and peer-to-peer progressive mesh streaming is discussed in detail.

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{c:conclusion}
This research concentrated on streaming of progressive meshes over network. 
First, the effect of dependency over lossy network was quantitatively analyzed. 
To enable quantitative analysis, an analytical model was developed to compute 
the probability distribution of the decoding time of each vertex split. 
Many experiments were carried out to verify the accuracy of the analytical model, 
and different network traces and progressive meshes were used to avoid bias. 
In these experiments, the predicted decoding time of vertex splits obtained 
with the analytical model was reasonably close to the measured one. 
Therefore, with the help of the analytical model, 
the quality of the received mesh could be predicted efficiently before transmission.
Consequently, adaptive transmitting vertex splits according to the network condition
becomes possible. Besides streaming of progressive meshes, 
streaming of other partially ordered data could also be modeled
with the analytical model in this thesis. 
For example, this model was successfully applied in streaming of 3D plants.

The analytical model in this thesis assumes that the packet losses 
are independent with each other, 
so a network trace with many burst packet losses may cause considerable error in the prediction. 
Gilbert model of packet loss may be used to obtain results that are more accurate, 
but using Gilbert model may significantly increase the complexity of the analytical model. 
Moreover, burst packet losses happen less commonly in the Internet
after widespread application of RED in routers. 
Therefore, the precision of the analytical model
without considering burst packet loss may be acceptable in most cases now.

It is observed in the experiments that the effect of dependency
is only significant in the short period at the beginning of transmission, 
and the length of this period increases
when the round trip time or packet loss rate increases. 
This observation is consistent with the result of the analytical model. 
Since each lost packet will be retransmitted as soon as the packet loss is detected, 
the effect of a packet loss is restricted to a certain period. 
This effect decreases with time because of two reasons. 
First, the contribution of the vertex splits sent decreases; 
second, the quality of the reconstructed mesh increases. 
Consequently, the relative value of the effect, 
represented as the ratio of the contribution of vertex
splits to the quality of the reconstructed mesh, decreases.
As a result, considering the dependency among the vertex splits 
is only needed for applications requiring high interactivity
because these applications require low initial latency. 
For these applications, the greedy method proposed in this thesis
could generate a adaptive sending strategy to reduce the initial latency. 

View-dependent streaming is needed in streaming of large meshes
to improve the quality quickly, but current implementations cannot be easily scaled
to large number of receivers because the sender is not stateless. 
To address this weakness, a receiver-driven view-dependent streaming system,
in which the sender is stateless, was proposed in this thesis. 
According to the experimental results, the receiver-driven approach
can reduce both the CPU usage and outgoing bandwidth of the sender significantly. 
Moving the visibility decision to the receiver reduces the overhead of the server. 
Moreover, it also reduces the outgoing bandwidth of the sender because the server
does not need to send the identifications of the vertex splits any more. 
Above all, a significant advantage of receiver-driven approach is that
now both the caching proxy and P2P techniques can be applied to increase the scalability of the system
because of the sender is stateless. 

The visibility decision made by the receiver may not be accurate 
because the receiver can only estimate the visibility based on
the partially received mesh. 
Visible vertices may be not displayed if their ancestor vertices are not visible. 
According to the current results, however, this kind of error is negligible in most cases. 
For applications that tolerate no error, 
further research could be done to remove this kind of error. 
A possible solution could be to split those vertices near the silhouette even when they are invisible.

To increase the scalability of the view-dependent mesh-streaming systems, 
a P2P mesh streaming system was proposed in this thesis based on the receiver-driven approach. 
According to the experimental results, the server overhead can be reduced by 90\%
and the response time is still close to the low bound. 
The control overhead introduced in this system is about 10\%, a reasonable value. 
The response time is low because most requests in this system are successful in the first try, 
and the message overhead is reasonable because the hierarchical group system proposed in this thesis effectively 
reduces the message overhead. 
The prototype developed in this thesis shows that P2P mesh streaming system is feasible
and it can significantly reduce the server cost when there are many clients.

The control overhead at 10\% is acceptable in this system since the majority of
control messages are transmitted among the peers and the server overhead keeps low. 
Nonetheless, the message overhead could be further reduced. 

During the study, it is found that in some cases the bottleneck can be the rendering of the meshes, 
especially when the graphic card is used in deciding the visibility of vertices. 
Improving the rendering efficiency of the progressive mesh during the streaming 
could be an interesting research problem.  
During the streaming, a progressive mesh with only partial modification is frequently re-rendered, 
so it is possible to exploit the similarity between two consecutive meshes to improve the rendering speed.
