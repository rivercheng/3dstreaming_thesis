    \begin{comment}
    High-resolution 3D meshes are increasingly available in networked
    applications, such as digital museum, online game, and virtual reality.
    The amount of data constituting a high-resolution 3D mesh can be
    huge, leading to a long downloading time. 
    To reduce the waiting time of users, 
    a common technique for remote viewing is progressive streaming,
    which allows a low-resolution version of the mesh to be transmitted
    and rendered with low latency. Then the quality of the transmitted 
    mesh can be incrementally improved when the refinement information
    is continuously being transmitted.

    Progressive mesh is commonly used to support progressive
    streaming. A progressive mesh comprises a \emph{base mesh} and a series
    of refinements. The base mesh is obtained by simplifying the original mesh
    with a series of \emph{edge collapses}.
    With the \emph{vertex splits}, the inverses of these edge
    collapses, the original mesh can be reconstructed from the base mesh.
    Therefore, progressive streaming can be implemented by sending the vertex
    splits as refinements after sending the base mesh.

    Although streaming of videos is extensively studied, 
    streaming of high-resolution progressive meshes is considerably different.
    Frames of a video are usually sent following the time order,
    vertex splits of a progressive mesh, however, can be sent in various of orders.
    Some new research problems arise due to the flexibility in sending order of 
    vertex splits. In this thesis, four related topics are discussed. 
    %After decoding, each frame contributes the same to a video, but vertex splits
    %in a progressive mesh vary considerably in their contribution to the quality
    %of the reconstructed mesh. 
       
    First, 
    %the effect of dependency needs to be considered in choosing
    %the sending order of vertex splits.
    the progressive coding of meshes introduces dependencies among 
    the vertex splits, and the descendants cannot be decoded
    before their ancestors are all decoded. Therefore, 
    when a progressive mesh is transmitted over a lossy network,
    a packet loss will delay the decoding of any following
    vertex split that depends on a vertex split in this lost packet. 
    %These successfully received vertex splits cannot be 
    %decoded until the lost packet is successfully retransmitted. 
    Hence, the effect of dependency needs to
    be considered in choosing the sending order of vertex splits. 
    %To find the effect of dependency
    %is non-trivial as the packet loss happens randomly.
    In this thesis, an analytical model is proposed to 
    %quantify the effect of dependency on the quality curve.
    quantitatively analyzes the effects of dependency
    by modeling the distribution of decoding time of each vertex split
    as a function of mesh properties and network parameters.
    %The quality curve is determined by the decoding time of the vertex
    %splits and their contributions to the overall mesh quality.    
    %The decoding time of a vertex split depends on its receiving time and the 
    %receiving time of its all ancestors. The receiving time of a vertex split
    %in turn depends on its sending time and how many times it is 
    %transmitted. 
    %Hence, the distribution of decoding time of each vertex split
    %is modeled as a function of the mesh property and the network condition.
    %From this expression, %both the expected value and 
    %the distribution of the decoding time of each
    %vertex split can be efficiently computed before transmission. 
    Consequently, Different sending orders can be  
    efficiently evaluated without simulations, 
    and this model can help in developing a sending
    strategy to improve the quality curve 
    during transmission. % to improve the quality.
    
    Furthermore, %closed-form expressions are derived in two extreme cases,
    this model is applied to study two extreme cases of dependency in 
    progressive meshes and
    %providing insights to the importance of dependencies on the
    %decoded mesh quality. 
    The main insight found is that if each lost packet
    is immediately retransmitted upon the packet loss is detected, 
    the effect of dependencies on decoded mesh quality diminishes with time.
    %the dependencies only matters in the first several round trip times. 
    Therefore, the effect of dependency is only significant in the applications
    requiring high interactivity. 

    The accuracy of the analylitical model proposed in this thesis is validated
    under a variety of network conditions, including bursty losses, fluctuating RTT,
    and varying sending rate. The values predicted from our model match the measured
    value reasonably well in all cases except when losses are too bursty.
    
    To further improve the quality curve, the viewpoint of the 
    user can be considered in deciding the sending order.
    %Usually, users can only see a part of a mesh, so sending non-visible data
    %before visible data wastes bandwidth. Moreover, 
    Non-visible vertex splits do not need to be sent, and 
    the visual contributions of visible vertex splits (how much they can improve the rendered image)
    also depend on the viewpoint of the user.
    Hence, choosing the sending order according to the viewpoint of the user, so called
    \emph{view-dependent streaming}, is a natural choice.
    
    In existing solutions to view-dependent streaming,  the
    sender decides the sending order. 
    %This sender-driven protocol has several
    %drawbacks. First, it is not scalable to many receivers as the sender has to
    %determine the visibility of vertices and sort the visible vertex splits based on their
    %visual contributions for each receiver. 
    %Second, 
    The sender needs to maintain
    the rendering state of each receiver to avoid sending duplicate data. 
    Due to the stateful design %and high computational requirements,
    the sender-driven approach cannot be easily extended to support 
    many receivers with caching proxy and peer-to-peer system,
    two common solutions to scalability. 

    In this thesis, a receiver-driven protocol is proposed to 
    improve the scalability. In this protocol, the receiver decides the sending order
    and explicitly requests the vertex splits, 
    while the sender simply sends the data requested.
    The sending order is computed at the receiver  by estimating the visibility
    and visual contributions of the refinements, even before receiving them,
    with the help of GPU.

    Because the visibility determination and state maintenance are all done by the receivers, 
    the sender in our receiver-driven protocol is stateless and free of complex computation.
    Furthermore, caching proxy and P2P streaming systems can be applied to improve
    the scalability without adding more servers.  
    
    The receiver-driven protocol significantly reduces the computing cost at the sender,
    but the bandwidth can remain the bottleneck if each receiver receives data
    from the same sender. 
    Based on the receiver-driven protocol, P2P techniques are applied to mesh
    streaming in this thesis. In the implementation of P2P mesh streaming system,
    two issues are considered: how to partition a progressive mesh into chunks and 
    how to lookup the provider of a chunk. For the latter issus, we investigated 
    into two solutions, which trade off server overhead and response time. The first
    uses a simple centralized lookup service, while the second organizes peers into
    groups according to the hierarchical structure of the progressive mesh to 
    take advantage of access pattern. Simulation results show that our 
    proposed systems are robust under high churn rate, reduce the server overhead
    by more than $90\%$, keep control overhead below $10\%s$, and achieve
    low average response time.

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{c:conclusion}
This research concentrated on streaming of progressive meshes over network. 
First, the effect of dependency over lossy network was quantitatively analyzed. 
To enable quantitative analysis, an analytical model was developed to compute 
the probability distribution of the decoding time of each vertex split. 
Many experiments were carried out to verify the accuracy of the analytical model, 
and different network traces and progressive meshes were used to avoid bias. 
In these experiments, the predicted decoding time of vertex splits obtained 
with the analytical model was reasonably close to the measured one. 
Therefore, with the help of the analytical model, 
the quality of the received mesh could be predicted efficiently before transmission.
Consequently, adaptive transmitting vertex splits according to the network condition
becomes possible. Besides streaming of progressive meshes, 
streaming of other partially ordered data could also be modeled
with the analytical model in this thesis. 
For example, this model was successfully applied in streaming of 3D plants.

The analytical model in this thesis assumes that the packet losses 
are independent with each other, 
so a network trace with many burst packet losses may cause considerable error in the prediction. 
Gilbert model of packet loss may be used to obtain results that are more accurate, 
but using Gilbert model may significantly increase the complexity of the analytical model. 
Moreover, burst packet losses happen less commonly in the Internet
after widespread application of RED in routers. 
Therefore, the precision of the analytical model
without considering burst packet loss may be acceptable in most cases now.

It is observed in the experiments that the effect of dependency
is only significant in the short period at the beginning of transmission, 
and the length of this period increases
when the round trip time or packet loss rate increases. 
This observation is consistent with the result of the analytical model. 
Since each lost packet will be retransmitted as soon as the packet loss is detected, 
the effect of a packet loss is restricted to a certain period. 
This effect decreases with time because of two reasons. 
First, the contribution of the vertex splits sent decreases; 
second, the quality of the reconstructed mesh increases. 
Consequently, the relative value of the effect, 
represented as the ratio of the contribution of vertex
splits to the quality of the reconstructed mesh, decreases.
As a result, considering the dependency among the vertex splits 
is only needed for applications requiring high interactivity
because these applications require low initial latency. 
For these applications, the greedy method proposed in this thesis
could generate a adaptive sending strategy to reduce the initial latency. 

View-dependent streaming is needed in streaming of large meshes
to improve the quality quickly, but current implementations cannot be easily scaled
to large number of receivers because the sender is not stateless. 
To address this weakness, a receiver-driven view-dependent streaming system,
in which the sender is stateless, was proposed in this thesis. 
According to the experimental results, the receiver-driven approach
can reduce both the CPU usage and outgoing bandwidth of the sender significantly. 
Moving the visibility decision to the receiver reduces the overhead of the server. 
Moreover, it also reduces the outgoing bandwidth of the sender because the server
does not need to send the identifications of the vertex splits any more. 
Above all, a significant advantage of receiver-driven approach is that
now both the caching proxy and P2P techniques can be applied to increase the scalability of the system
because of the sender is stateless. 

The visibility decision made by the receiver may not be accurate 
because the receiver can only estimate the visibility based on
the partially received mesh. 
Visible vertices may be not displayed if their ancestor vertices are not visible. 
According to the current results, however, this kind of error is negligible in most cases. 
For applications that tolerate no error, 
further research could be done to remove this kind of error. 
A possible solution could be to split those vertices near the silhouette even when they are invisible.

To increase the scalability of the view-dependent mesh-streaming systems, 
a P2P mesh streaming system was proposed in this thesis based on the receiver-driven approach. 
According to the experimental results, the server overhead can be reduced by 90\%
and the response time is still close to the low bound. 
The control overhead introduced in this system is about 10\%, a reasonable value. 
The response time is low because most requests in this system are successful in the first try, 
and the message overhead is reasonable because the hierarchical group system proposed in this thesis effectively 
reduces the message overhead. 
The prototype developed in this thesis shows that P2P mesh streaming system is feasible
and it can significantly reduce the server cost when there are many clients.

The control overhead at 10\% is acceptable in this system since the majority of
control messages are transmitted among the peers and the server overhead keeps low. 
Nonetheless, the message overhead could be further reduced. 

During the study, it is found that in some cases the bottleneck can be the rendering of the meshes, 
especially when the graphic card is used in deciding the visibility of vertices. 
Improving the rendering efficiency of the progressive mesh during the streaming 
could be an interesting research problem.  
During the streaming, a progressive mesh with only partial modification is frequently re-rendered, 
so it is possible to exploit the similarity between two consecutive meshes to improve the rendering speed.
