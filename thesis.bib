  abstract = {A packet-loss resilient, bandwidth-scalable 3{D} graphics streaming
	system is proposed. It uses the compressed progressive mesh (CPM)
	algorithm (see Pajarola, R. and Rossignac, J., IEEE Trans. on Visualization
	and Computer Graphics, vol.6, no.1, p.79-93, 2000) to generate a
	hierarchical bit-stream to represent different levels of details
	(LODs). We assign forward error correction (FEC) codes to each layer
	in the encoded bit-stream according to its importance. To this end,
	we develop a new distortion measure that quantifies the distortion
	in the reconstructed mesh when part of the bit-stream is lost. Experimental
	results with a collection of 3D meshes have been conducted to demonstrate
	the efficacy of our solution. They indicate that with our proposed
	unequal error protection (UEP), the decoded mesh quality degrades
	more gracefully, compared to either no error protection (NEP) or
	equal error protection (EEP) methods, as the packet loss rate increases.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an unequal error protection method for packet-loss
	resilient transmission of progressively compressed 3D meshes. The
	proposed method is based on a source and channel coding approach
	where we set up a theoretical framework for the overall system by
	which the channel packet loss behavior and the channel bandwidth
	can be directly related to the decoded mesh quality at the receiver.
	In particular, we develop a statistical distortion measure and optimize
	it to compute the best combination of (i) the number of triangles
	to transmit, (ii) the total number of channel coding bits, and (iii)
	the distribution of these error-protection bits among the transmitted
	layers in order to maximize the expected decoded mesh quality at
	the receiver. The proposed method differs from the earlier approaches
	in two major aspects: (i) determination of the number of channel
	coding bits (C) and (ii) the approach of reducing the source rate
	in order to accommodate for channel coding bits. When the proposed
	method is used to transmit a typical 3D mesh over a channel with
	a 10% packet loss rate, the distortion (measured using the Hausdorff
	distance between the original and the decoded overly sampled meshes)
	is reduced by 50% compared to the case when no error protection is
	applied.},

  abstract = {We use the abbreviations tet and tri for tetrahedron and triangle.
	TetStreamer encodes a Delaunay tet mesh in a back-to-front visibility
	order and streams it from a server to a client (volumetric visualizer).
	During decompression, the server performs the view-dependent back-to-front
	sorting of the tets by identifying and deactivating one free tet
	at a time. A tet is free when all its back faces are on the sheet.
	The sheet is a tri mesh separating active and inactive tets. It is
	initialized with the back-facing boundary of the mesh. It is compressed
	using EdgeBreaker and transmitted first. It is maintained by both
	the server and the client and advanced towards the viewer passing
	one free tet at a time. The client receives a compressed bit stream
	indicating where to attach free tets to the sheet. It renders each
	free tet and updates the sheet by either flipping a concave edge,
	removing a concave valence-3 vertex, or inserting a new vertex to
	split a tri. TetStreamer compresses the connectivity of the whole
	let mesh to an average of about 1.7 bits per tet. The footprint (in-core
	memory required by the client) needs only to hold the evolving sheet,
	which is a small fraction of the storage that would be required by
	the entire tet-mesh. Hence, TetStreamer permits us to receive, decompress,
	and visualize or process very large meshes on clients with a small
	in-core memory. Furthermore, it permits us to use volumetric visualization
	techniques, which require that the mesh be processed in view-dependent
	back-to-front order, at no extra memory, performance or transmission
	cost.},

  abstract = {An efficient progressive compression and interactive transmission
	algorithm for 3D normal meshes, based on rate-distortion optimization,
	are proposed in this work. A normal mesh is partitioned into several
	segments, which are encoded independently. By truncating the bitstream
	for each segment optimally using a distortion model, the proposed
	algorithm yields a higher coding gain than the conventional approach.
	Moreover, to support interactive transmission of 3D models from client's
	viewpoint, each segment can be endowed with different priority of
	transmission. The view-dependent processing technique enables to
	reduce the transmission bandwidth considerably while maintaining
	the same visual quality.},

  abstract = {Most existing coding techniques for three-dimensional (3-D) graphic
	models focus on coding efficiency. Due to irregular structure of
	the 3-D mesh and the use of variable length entropy codes, channel
	errors often propagate in the coded bitstream and severely distort
	the decoded model. By segmenting a 3-D graphic model (or its connected
	components) into small pieces, the impact of channel errors is confined
	to directly corrupted pieces rather than the whole mesh. The mesh
	segmentation schemes should be compatible with the underlying encoding
	techniques to achieve the low computational and coding overhead.
	In this research, we examine four mesh segmentation schemes, i.e.,
	multiseed traversal, threshold traversal, morphing-based volume splitting,
	and content-based segmentation, and apply them to the context of
	error resilient mesh coding based on the constructive traversal coding
	technique. The advantages and shortcomings of each segmentation method
	are discussed. These schemes segment a mesh into pieces according
	to the target piece size that is determined according to the channel
	error rate.},

	coding efficiency, which makes them extremely sensitive to channel
	errors due to the irregular mesh structure. We introduce a new approach
	for error-resilient coding of arbitrary 3-D graphic models by extending
	the error-free constructive traversal compression scheme proposed
	by Li and Kuo (see MPEG-4 Tokyo Meeting, 1998, Contribution Doc.
	M3324, and Proc. IEEE, vol.86, p.1052-63, 1998). A 3-D mesh of an
	arbitrary structure is partitioned into pieces of a smaller uniform
	size with joint boundaries. The size of a piece is determined adaptively
	based on the channel error rate. The topology and geometry information
	of each joint boundary and each piece of a connected component is
	coded independently. The coded topology and first several important
	bit-planes of the joint-boundary data are protected against channel
	errors by using the Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem error-correcting code.
	At the decoder, each piece is decoded and checked for channel errors.
	The decoded joint-boundary information is used to perform data recovery
	and error concealment on the corrupted piece data. All decoded pieces
	are combined together according to their configuration to reconstruct
	all connected components of the complete 3-D model. Our experiments
	demonstrate that the proposed approach has excellent error resiliency
	at a reasonable bit-rate overhead. The techniques is also capable
	of incrementally rendering one connected component of the 3-D model
	at a time},
